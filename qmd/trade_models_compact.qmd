> **TL;DR**: This is a compact, no-frills reference you can render to HTML without big white-space gaps. It highlights the main models used by the World Bank, IMF, OECD, UNCTAD, and WTO; what they are good for; and whether they include sectoral detail and migration.

## 1. One-screen overview

| Institution | Representative model(s) | Model class | Typical scope | Sector detail | Regions | Migration/labor mobility | Often used for |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| **World Bank** | GTAP-based CGE (e.g., ENVISAGE/Linkage lineage), **WITS/SMART** (partial equilibrium) | CGE; Partial Eq. | Trade policy, global shocks, tariffs/NTBs | High (CGE) | Global | Limited (usually static mobility within/between sectors; migration occasionally via scenarios/links) | Tariff/NTB reforms, regional agreements, carbon border issues |
| **IMF** | **GIMF**, open-economy DSGE variants, external-sector frameworks (EBA-lite) | DSGE / macro-econometric | Macro-financial + trade spillovers | Low–medium | Multi-region | Rarely explicit; labor supply shocks sometimes | Fiscal/monetary spillovers, terms-of-trade shocks, current-account analysis |
| **OECD** | **METRO** (GTAP-based CGE), ICIO/TiVA-linked tools | CGE (+ ICIO accounting) | Supply chains, NTBs, services trade | High | Global | Usually limited; can approximate via labor market closures | Value chains, services trade, regulatory frictions, CBAM |
| **UNCTAD** | **Global Policy Model (GPM)**; TRAINS + toolkit; partial-eq. analyses | Stock–flow macro (GPM); Partial Eq. | Macro-development scenarios with trade channels | Low–medium | Global | Can incorporate demographic/labor supply scenarios | Development strategies, global demand shifts, debt/trade interplay |
| **WTO** | Econometric trade forecast models; CGE studies (often GTAP-based via partners) | Econometric; CGE (via studies) | Global trade monitoring & scenarios | Medium–high (in CGE studies) | Global | Typically not explicit | Forecasts, monitoring, scenario rundowns in flagship reports |

## 2. What each institution’s stack does best (and where to be cautious)

### World Bank
- **Strengths**
  - GTAP-based CGE lineage widely used and documented; rich sectoral detail; integrates tariffs, NTBs, and policy instruments.
  - **WITS/SMART** is fast for **tariff-line** partial-equilibrium what-if analysis.
- **Watch-outs**
  - Comparative-static CGE settings can underplay dynamics and financial channels.
  - Migration often handled indirectly (exogenous labor supply or linked modules).
- **Typical insights**
  - Welfare/real income effects by region/sector; trade creation/diversion; incidence by factor owners; CBAM pass-through.

### IMF
- **Strengths**
  - **GIMF** and open-economy DSGE are strong on **intertemporal dynamics**, expectations, policy rules, and macro-financial spillovers.
  - External-sector frameworks (e.g., EBA-lite) tie trade balances to fundamentals for policy assessment.
- **Watch-outs**
  - Sectoral granularity is thinner than CGE; trade structure stylized.
  - Migration rarely explicit beyond labor supply/participation shocks.
- **Typical insights**
  - Fiscal/monetary mix under ToT shocks; current-account adjustments; debt dynamics with imported-inflation channels.

### OECD
- **Strengths**
  - **METRO** (CGE) couples detailed sectors with **services and regulatory frictions**, well suited to **GVC** questions.
  - ICIO/TiVA enables consistent value-added trade decomposition.
- **Watch-outs**
  - As with CGE: dynamics are stylized; financial constraints & distributional channels limited.
- **Typical insights**
  - Sourcing substitution, domestic value-added in exports, sectoral winners/losers of NTB changes, CBAM impacts along chains.

### UNCTAD
- **Strengths**
  - **GPM** emphasizes **demand-led, stock–flow consistent macro** structure with developing-country focus.
  - TRAINS database and toolkits offer tariff/NTB evidence for partial-eq. exercises.
- **Watch-outs**
  - Sectoral detail lower than CGE; trade structure often aggregated.
- **Typical insights**
  - Global demand and commodity cycles, distribution, external constraints, growth–trade–debt interactions.

### WTO
- **Strengths**
  - **Econometric now/forecast** models for global trade volumes; convenes/commissions CGE scenario work.
- **Watch-outs**
  - Forecasts depend on global GDP assumptions; policy incidence by sector often comes from partner CGE studies.
- **Typical insights**
  - Near-term trade growth paths, risks, and alternative scenarios; synthesis of policy impacts across studies.

## 3. Sectoral scope, regions, migration (at a glance)

- **Sectoral scope**: CGE families (World Bank, OECD, partner studies for WTO) provide the richest **HS/ISIC→GTAP** sector mapping; IMF/UNCTAD macro models are coarser.
- **Regions**: All offer **global, multi-region** setups; disaggregation varies by study and data vintage.
- **Migration / labor mobility**:
  - Commonly **limited** in baseline CGE closures (labor mobile across sectors within a region; international migration usually exogenous).
  - Macro models (IMF, UNCTAD) may incorporate **labor supply/demography** scenarios rather than explicit migration microstructure.
  - Dedicated migration–trade linkages often handled **via linked modules** or external literature rather than core models.

## 4. Policy questions these models are good at

- **Tariff/NTB reforms & trade agreements** → CGE (WB/OECD; WTO via studies): incidence by sector/region; rules-of-origin tests; CBAM leakage.
- **Macro-financial spillovers of trade shocks** → IMF DSGE/GIMF: terms-of-trade; imported inflation; policy rules; current account.
- **GVC restructuring / resilience** → OECD METRO + TiVA/ICIO: sourcing shifts, value-added, services linkages.
- **Development & external constraints** → UNCTAD GPM: demand regimes, commodity cycles, debt–trade nexus.
- **Short-run trade forecasts & risks** → WTO econometrics: monitoring and scenario bands.

## 5. Modeling notes you may care about (compact)

- **Calibration & data**: GTAP social accounting matrices; IO/ICIO for TiVA; national accounts and BoP for macro models.
- **Dynamics**: Many CGE runs are **comparative-static**; DSGE/GIMF offer intertemporal expectations; GPM is stock–flow consistent with adjustment dynamics.
- **Distributional detail**: Limited in standard CGE/DSGE; distributional incidence requires extensions or microsimulation linkages.
- **Climate/trade**: CBAM and embodied carbon are increasingly integrated in OECD/WB CGE workflows; macro models treat carbon via shocks/taxes with simplified abatement.
