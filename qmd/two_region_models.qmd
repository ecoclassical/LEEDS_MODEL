## Overview

Two-region macroeconomic models are widely used to analyze international spillovers, financial imbalances, exchange-rate regimes, and climate policy coordination. This note summarizes **policy recommendations/insights**, whether models address **migration flows**, and whether they are **single- or multi-sector**.

## 1. Backus–Kehoe–Kydland (1992)

**Tradition:** Real Business Cycle (RBC)  
**Regions:** Home vs. Foreign

**Core mechanism:** International comovement arises from productivity shocks and trade/financial linkages under frictionless competitive markets (with incomplete asset markets in practice).

**Policy insights:**
- Observed consumption comovements are lower than predicted → **risk-sharing is incomplete**; financial frictions, home bias, or capital controls matter.
- Highlights the need to model **incomplete international asset markets** for policy-relevant conclusions.

**Migration:** Not modeled (labor immobile).  
**Sectors:** One representative tradable sector.

---

## 2. Obstfeld–Rogoff (1995, 2001)

**Tradition:** Two-country New Keynesian open economy  
**Regions:** Two symmetric/asymmetric countries

**Core mechanism:** Monopolistic competition, nominal rigidities, pricing-to-market, and international asset trade generate rich **policy spillovers**.

**Policy insights:**
- Under sticky prices, **independent monetary policy** may not be globally optimal; **policy coordination** can raise welfare relative to Nash behavior.
- Exchange-rate regime choice interacts with nominal rigidities and home bias; pass-through and pricing-to-market shape optimal rules.

**Migration:** Not modeled.  
**Sectors:** Typically **two** (tradables and non-tradables, differentiated varieties).

---

## 3. Galí & Monacelli (2005)

**Tradition:** Small Open Economy New Keynesian (derived from a two-country setup)  
**Regions:** Small domestic economy interacting with the rest of world

**Core mechanism:** Incomplete exchange-rate pass-through, Calvo price-setting, and foreign demand shocks.

**Policy insights:**
- Optimal monetary rule: target **domestic inflation** and **output gap**, not the exchange rate; small economies retain **monetary autonomy** even with high openness.
- Provides microfoundations for modern inflation-targeting in open economies.

**Migration:** Not modeled.  
**Sectors:** One composite good (extensions split into tradables/non-tradables).

## 4. Godley & Lavoie (2007) – Open-Economy SFC

**Tradition:** Stock–Flow Consistent (SFC) macro with two countries  
**Regions:** Domestic vs. Foreign

**Core mechanism:** Full accounting of sectoral balance sheets and flow consistency; current account surpluses/deficits matched by opposite financial positions.

**Policy insights:**
- **External and internal balances must cohere**; persistent current-account imbalances have balance-sheet consequences.
- **Coordinated fiscal policy** can sustain demand without unsustainable debt accumulation.
- Warns against **export-led mercantilism** as a generalized strategy.

**Migration:** Not explicit in the canonical chapters; extensions add remittances and labor flows.  
**Sectors:** **Multi-sector** (households, firms, government, banks; often CB).

---

## 5. Bhaduri–Marglin and Extensions (Onaran, Blecker)

**Tradition:** Post-Keynesian, demand-driven growth with open economy linkages  
**Regions:** Two economies with interacting demand regimes (wage-led vs. profit-led)

**Core mechanism:** Income distribution affects aggregate demand, investment, and net exports; spillovers transmit demand regimes across borders.

**Policy insights:**
- **Wage suppression** abroad can depress global demand; a “race to the bottom” harms growth.
- Advocates **coordinated wage and fiscal policies** to raise global growth and employment.

**Migration:** Generally not explicit; can be incorporated via labor supply or remittances.  
**Sectors:** Usually **one** production sector (goods); some extensions separate capital goods/energy.

---

## 6. Palley (2015) – Structural Keynesian North–South

**Tradition:** Structural Keynesian with North–South asymmetries  
**Regions:** Core (high-wage, high-productivity) vs. Periphery (low-wage, dependent)

**Core mechanism:** Asymmetric wage structures, technology gaps, and financial dependence shape trade and growth outcomes.

**Policy insights:**
- Calls for **industrial policy**, **capital management techniques**, and labor-market institutions in the South to prevent divergence.
- Recommends **re-regulating global finance** to stabilize external balances.

**Migration:** Sometimes present as a distributional/bargaining channel.  
**Sectors:** Often **two** (primary vs. manufacturing).

## 7. Ecological & Unequal-Exchange Two-Region Models

### 7.1 D’Alessandro & Luzzati (2014)
**Tradition:** Ecological macro/structuralist two-region frameworks  
**Policy insights:** Trade-based growth is constrained by environmental limits; recommends **Northern demand reduction** alongside **Southern ecological industrialization** and technology transfer.  
**Migration:** Typically not modeled explicitly.  
**Sectors:** **Multi-sector** (energy/resources + goods).

### 7.2 Rezai & Stagl (2016)
**Tradition:** Climate-policy spillovers in two-region macro  
**Policy insights:** **Carbon pricing** in the North can worsen Southern terms of trade without redistribution; recommends **global sharing of climate rents** and transfers.  
**Migration:** Not modeled.  
**Sectors:** **Multi-sector** (energy + final goods).

---

## 8. RICE / DICE (Nordhaus)

**Tradition:** Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs) with multiple regions; two-region variants are common for pedagogy  
**Core mechanism:** Output and emissions feed climate dynamics and damages which feed back to output.

**Policy insights:**
- Decentralized equilibria **under-abate** emissions; **cooperative carbon pricing** yields higher global welfare.
- Useful for analyzing international **climate agreements** and burden-sharing.

**Migration:** Not modeled (population exogenous).  
**Sectors:** Two broad blocks (production and climate/damages), often enriched with energy detail in RICE-type models.

---

## 9. Mundell–Fleming and Dornbusch Overshooting

**Tradition:** Open-economy IS–LM (Mundell–Fleming) and sticky-price exchange-rate dynamics (Dornbusch)  
**Regions:** Two-country intuition often used, though canonical models are single small open economy

**Policy insights:**
- With high capital mobility and fixed exchange rates, **monetary policy loses autonomy**; under flexible rates, stabilization is possible but with **exchange-rate volatility**.
- Forms the backbone of the **impossible trinity**.

**Migration:** Not modeled.  
**Sectors:** One composite tradable sector.

## Notes on Migration Modeling

- **Rare in macro two-region cores**; when present, migration is usually exogenous or via partial equilibrium channels (remittances, labor supply).  
- **Where to look:** development/structuralist models (Lewis, Harris–Todaro), SFC/ABMs adding migration/remittances (e.g., Caiani et al., Dafermos et al.).  
- **Frontier direction:** endogenize migration decisions linked to wage differentials, climate damages, and policy (industrial policy, carbon pricing), with feedback to sectoral demand and public finance.
